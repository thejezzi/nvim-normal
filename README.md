## Install (Linux/MacOS)
```sh
# Strongly recommended: Fork the repo and clone YOUR fork.
git clone https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## Install (Windows)
```sh
# Strongly recommended: Fork the repo and clone YOUR fork.
git clone https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim.git %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\nvim && nvim
```

## Dependencies
NormalNvim will connect to the internet the first time you open it to download the plugins. But [to unlock all features you must install the dependencies](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/wiki/dependencies).

## Distro features

* ‚ö° **Lazy:** Plugins are loaded lazily, providing super fast performance.
* üòé **Plugins are self-contained:** Allowing you to easily delete what you don't want.
* üîã **Batteries included:** Most [plugins](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/wiki/plugins) you will ever need are included and debugged by default. Get the best user experience out of the box and forget about nasty bugs in your Neovim config.
* ü§ñ **IDE tools:** We ship [Compiler.nvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/compiler.nvim) (compiler), [DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) (debugger), [Neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) (test runner), and [Dooku.nvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/dooku.nvim) (docs generator)
* üêû **IDE parsers:** Linters, Formatters, LSP, Treesitter... preinstalled, preconfigured and ready to code for the top 12 most popular programming languages.
* üîí **Plugin version lock:** You can choose "stable" or "nightly" update channels. Or if you prefer, use :NvimFreezePluginVersions to create your own stable versions!
* üîô **Rollbacks:** You can easily recover from a nvim distro update using :NvimRollbackRestore
* üî• **Hot reload:** Every time you change something in your config, the changes are reflected on nvim on real time without need to restart.
* üì± **Phone friendly:** You can also install it on Android Termux. Did you ever have a compiler in your pocket? üòâ
* ‚å®Ô∏è **Alternative mappings:** By default the distro uses qwerty, but colemak-dh can be found [here](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/wiki).
* ‚ù§Ô∏è **We don't treat you like you are stupid:** Code comments guide you to easily customize everything. We will never [hide or abstract](https://i.imgur.com/FCiZvp2.png) stuff from you.

## Philosophy and design decisions
__You are expected to fork the project before cloning it. So you are the only one in control. It is also recommended to use [neovim's appimage](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).__

> This is not a distro you are expected to update often from upstream. It is meant to be used as a base to create your own distro.

[NormalNvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/NormalNvim) won't be the next [/r/UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) sensation. It is a normal nvim config you can trust 100% will never unexpectedly break while you are working. Nothing flashy. Nothing brightful. Just bread and butter.

## Commands

|  Command            | Description                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **:checkhealth base** | Check the system dependencies you are missing. |
| **:NvimUpdateConfig** | Pulls the latest changes from the current git repository of your nvim config. Useful to keep your config updated when you use it in more than one machine. If the updates channel is `stable` this command will pull from the latest available tag release in your github repository. Only tag releases starting by 'v', such as v1.0.0 are recognized. It is also possible to define a specific stable version in `2-lazy.lua` by setting the option `stable_vesion_release`. If the channel is `nightly` it will pull from the nightly branch. Note that uncommited local changes in your config will be lost after an update, so it's important you commit before updating your distro config. |
| **:NvimRollbackCreate** | Creates a recovery point. It is triggered automatically when running `:NvimUpdateConfig`. | 
| **:NvimRollbackRestore** | Uses git to bring your config to the state it had when `:NvimRollbackCreate` was called. | 
| **:NvimReload** | Hot reloads the config without leaving nvim. It can cause unexpected issues sometimes. It is automatically triggered when writing the files `1-options.lua` and `4-mappings`. |
| **:NvimUpdatePlugins** | Uses lazy to update the plugins. |
| **:NvimFreezePluginVersions** | Saves your current plugin versions into `lazy_versions.lua` in your config directory. If you are using the `stable` updates channel, this file will be used to decide what plugin versions will be installed, and even if you manually try to update your plugins using lazy package manager, the versions file will be respected. If you are using the `nightly` channel, the first time you open nvim, the versions from `lazy_versions.lua` will be installed, but it will be possible to download the last versions by manually updating your plugins with lazy. Note that after running this command, you can manually modify `lazy_versions.lua` in case you only want to freeze some plugins. |
| **:CloseNotificaitons** | Close all notifications. This is automatically triggered by default when writting a buffer. |
| **:NvimVersion** | Prints the commit number of the current NormalNvim version. |

## FAQ
Please before opening an issue, check the [astrocommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) repo where you can find help about how to install and configure most plugins.

* **NormalNvim is not working. How can I know why?**

    `:checkhealth base`

* **Supports Windows?**
Yes, 100%. This is not necessary, but we strongly recommend you to launch NormalNvim [using WLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFbLUEQsRhM) so you can install [the required dependencies](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/wiki/dependencies) to unlock all features.

* **How can I disable the tabline?** On the options file, search for `showtabline` and set it to 0. If instead you want to remove the functionality completely from nvim, then check the plugin heirline. Here is where we implement the tabline logic. Also check [./lua/base/utils/status.lua](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/blob/main/lua/base/utils/status.lua) if you want to delete heirline helper functions.

* **How can I disable the animations?** You can delete the plugin [mini.animate](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.animate). In case you only want to disable some animations look into the plugin docs.

* **How can I use `Ask chatgpt`?** On your operative system, set the next env var. You can get an API key from [chatgpt's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY="my_key_here"
```

* **What scenarios are not covered by this distro?**
  * **Kubernetes**: We do not provide a kubernetes plugin. But we recommend using friendly-snippets, to quickly write code, and [overseer.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/overseer.nvim) to run kubernetes commands from inside nvim without having to wait for the server response.
  * **e2e testing**: We do not provide an e2e plugin. But we do provide the :TestNodejsE2e command you can customize on [/lua/base/3-autocmds.lua](https://github.com/Zeioth/NormalNvim/blob/main/lua/base/3-autocmds.lua) along with all the other testing commands. You can also rename the commands to anything you want in case you don't use nodejs.

## Credits
Originally it took AstroNvim as base. But implements [this VIM config](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) with some extras. Code has been simplified while retaining its core features. NormalNvim has also contributed to the code of many of the plugins included, in order to debug them and make them better.

Special thanks to LeoRed04 for designing the logo.

## Roadmap
* Creating a landing page.
